# iMessageTextAnalysis
To get different statistics about iMessage conversations

This is a little project I worked on for my girlfriend to analyze our text conversation over six months.
The end result was some graphs detailing our most frequent words (combined, by person), most frequently texted times, etc.

I used Python to do the word frequency counts, and DB Browser for SQLite for returning pretty much all the other statistics. All the data was imported into Power BI and graphs/visuals were made there.
